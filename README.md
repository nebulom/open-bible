# open-bible

This is an initial attempt to encode bible data ang hopefully to open it as JSON file so it's friendly to apps for consumption.

Initial app goes to, http://open-bible.scoollabs.com

## API

Sample of getting books is at http://open-bible.scoollabs.com/api/get_books

Or getting the chapters of Genesis, http://open-bible.scoollabs.com/api/get_chapters?book=Genesis

We will add more functions to it soon, as we need it.

## Others

Other plans include making an app for Ubuntu Touch using these JSON files and open this to everyone soon.
