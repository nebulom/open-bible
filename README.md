# open-bible

This is an initial attempt to encode bible data ang hopefully to open it as JSON file so it's friendly to apps for consumption.

Initial app to push data to, http://open-bible.scoollabs.com/books

No security yet, so we need to encode only correct data. For reference, here's the source we copied from https://www.bible.com/bible/1/GEN.1.KJV

## api

We will publish it at http://open-bible.scoollabs.com/api/get_books

Or getting the chapters or Genesis, http://open-bible.scoollabs.com/api/get_chapters?book=Genesis

We will add more functions to it soon, as we need it.
