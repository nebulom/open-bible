# open-bible

This is an initial attempt to encode bible data ang hopefully to open it as JSON file so it's friendly to apps for consumption.

Initial app goes to, http://open-bible.scoollabs.com/ Books that are not encoded yet are not readable. Work is still in progress for other books. See issues here, https://github.com/nebulom/open-bible/issues

For reference, encoders should check here, https://www.bible.com/bible/1/GEN.1.KJV 

## API

Sample of getting books is at http://open-bible.scoollabs.com/api/get_books

Or getting the chapters of Genesis, http://open-bible.scoollabs.com/api/get_chapters?book=Genesis

We will add more functions to it soon, as we need it.
